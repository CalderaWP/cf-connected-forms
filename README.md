# Caldera Connected Forms
Create sequences of forms with conditional logic. Split your forms into smaller pieces, with total control over what comes next. Use to combine multiple forms into one, create complex and variable registration and sales paths, surveys, quizzes and more. Take control of a complex process with the simple user interface you've come to expect from Caldera Forms.

Requires Caldera Forms 1.3.1 beta 1 or later. As of now you will need to install from [the current-dev branch of Caldera Forms Github repo](https://github.com/Desertsnowman/Caldera-Forms/tree/current-dev).
